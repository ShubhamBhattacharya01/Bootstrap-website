I am using the Bootstrap framework to create a single-page website. It's so easy to work with! I prefer Bootstrap over Tailwind because I don’t fully understand Tailwind yet—just kidding! Bootstrap provides a 12-column layout, and many companies use it. However, a lot of companies choose to use native CSS instead of a framework.
